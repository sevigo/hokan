# Hokan

The idea of Hokan (保管 safekeeping) is to store changed files automatically to some cloud or whatever is implemented as a target storage provider. I use native windows/linux API to get notifications on file changes (with some CGO,  see [notify](https://github.com/sevigo/notify)).

Disclaimer: This version is unstable and heavily under development, don't use it for anything!
